# Employee Tracker

## Data base Tables

There are three tables, the "employeee table" is related to the "role tabel" via a foreign key, similarly the "role table" is connected to department table.

- **1) department**

- **2) role**

- **3) employee**

## Data base structure:

The main structure of the tables are in the schema and all the values that are assigned are in seed file.I seperated them to be able to modify the database easier.

- **I) schema**

- **II) seed**


## User Input:

- **I) Adding Departemnt**
- **II) Adding roles**
- **II) Adding employees**




Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

- Add departments, roles, employees

- View departments, roles, employees
